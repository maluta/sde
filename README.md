# android-quiz-parse-example
A sample android application for a simple multiple choice quiz - powered by parse.com

Following up to the old-school android 1.5 quiz app that i shared as a tutorial ages ago, I thought I would re-vamp the quiz a little to use a newer version of android and power the quiz using parse.com rather than a local sqllite DB.  First commit is just the quiz stuff, but will update to include top scores and user login etc.
